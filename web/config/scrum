Scrum
- New UI layout
- FB Integration in UI
- Bind FB session to local session

Right now I'm having a very strange problem; I don't know if it's Firefox or jQuery,
but somehow the Cookie sent by the browser is different when I do an Ajax POST
request; so when the server receives that request it doesn't find a valid Session since
sessions are Cookie-based.
